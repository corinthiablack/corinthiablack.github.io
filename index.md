## Evolution of Shape in Fishes
Hi all! My name is Corinthia (Cori) Black.

I am a PhD candidate at Auburn University in the Armbruster lab. 

My research focuses on the intersection of shape, function, ecology, and phylogeography of the Neotropical family Loricariidae, the Suckermouth Armored Catfishes.
